### Introduction
    
Our pitch is a focused vision for a Rails based CRUD app that will appeal to a niche market and hopefully scale to a global audience. The concept we would like to move forward with will initially be titled RICKIFY with the possibility of a MEMEIFY rebrand if additional features develop past prototype phase. 

The MVP for RICKIFY is to have USERS register, sign-in, upload their photos, create a new image by adding on a "unibrow" image, then have those pieces added under their user account. Technologies we are exploring to put this into action are facial-recognition API's, a Facebook API that will automatically upload FB profile pictures upon signing in, amongst other options we are still looking into.
